## Installation
To use the project, you need to assemble the device and flash it. The assembly diagram is presented at the root of the project.

The device does not provide for connecting and using a keyboard to enter a password, therefore, this data must be specified in the firmware itself. To do this, after copying the contents of the *WiretappingScanner_Firmware.ino* file to the ArduinoIDE sketch in the *WIFI section* of the firmware, enter the network name and network password in the *ssid* and *password* constants, respectively. After that, you can flash esp32. In the *monitor* at a *frequency of 9600*, you can view the *IP address of the esp32*, which can be used to connect in the program.
