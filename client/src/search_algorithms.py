	"""
	Imagine that we need to do a numbered search on a file with the same name, for
	example, IRDrawFrameScreen.png, and the numbering, respectively, will be
	IRDrawFrameScreen0001.png, IRDrawFrameScreen0002.png, etc. Let's say the last file is:
	`IRDrawFrameScreen0176.png`
	The function will do everything for the programmer. It is enough to pass the name of the file
	(it is also possible with the full path to the file) and the numeric format of the enumeration
	(in our case '{:04}'). We get the string:
	`lastIndex('IRDrawFrameScreen.png', '{:04}')`
	This function will return the full name of the file with the next number
	after the last one (this is very convenient for saving the file):
	`IRDrawFrameScreen0177.png`
	Then you can save the new file:
	`self.IRDrawFrame.grab().save(lastIndex('IRDrawFrameScreen.png', '{:04}'))`
	Another example:
	`with open(lastIndex("log.txt", "{:07}"), "wt") as save: save.write(self.consoleBrowser.toPlainText())`

	:param file_name: Name (possibly path) of the file
	:param number_format: Digital format
	:return: The next file number in the format
