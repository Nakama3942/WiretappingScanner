## Installation
Before using the program, it is necessary to comply with certain conditions:
- [ ] Most importantly, you need to install, of course, [the graphical framework](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6/): ```pip install pyqt6```;
- [ ] To display a beautiful modern interface, [the theme-library PyQtDarkTheme](https://github.com/5yutan5/PyQtDarkTheme) was used: ```pip install pyqtdarktheme```;
- [ ] If you modify the program, then the [pyqt-tools](https://pypi.org/project/pyqt-tools/) utility is used to convert the Qt .ui file: ```pip install pyqt-tools```;
- [ ] Even if Nmap is not installed on the system and will not be used, it is necessary to install the ```pip install python-nmap``` [library](https://pypi.org/project/python-nmap/).
	- [ ] However, if you want to use Nmap, we recommend [the official source of the developer](https://nmap.org/download.html).
	- [ ] After installing the program, add Nmap to your system PATH variables. Now WiretappingScanner will scan all devices on the local network with a static(!) IP address.
	- [ ] To make the device visible on the network: connect it to your Wi-Fi and set the device's IP address to static in the local network settings. Now Nmap will be able to detect your device on the local network, and you can connect it to the program.
- [ ] For the logger to work, of course, you need to install the logging library. For these purposes, I developed and wrote my [own logging library](https://pypi.org/project/mighty-logger/). You can install it with the following command: ```pip install mighty-logger==0.5.1```. You need to install this particular version, since the library will continue to develop, and the software will soon finish its development and there may be problems using the library.
- [ ] The author actively uses the Markdown format, and some windows in the program are designed using this markup syntax. And to support it, you need to install the [markdown_it](https://pypi.org/project/markdown-it-py/) library: ```pip install markdown-it-py```.

After that, you can safely use the program. However, if you don't want to bother with preparation and setup - just download the compiled program from the archive in the release. You can also find the assembly diagram of the device and its firmware there.
